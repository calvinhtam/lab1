				DSC 102 - Data Visualization Project 1
			</a>
			<h4>Description:</h4>
			<p>Here I basically did a fun project about Robert Downey Jr. and his work as an actor. </br>
				It pretty much has three main visualizations. The first is a choropleth map of where </br>
				his movies were produced. The second is a circle packing graph where the size of the </br>
				categories is related to the movies/genres revenue size. The third is a word cloud </br>
				of some common words showing up in quick movie descriptions of the movie. </br>
				Note that there is some angst in the website because I was quite upset with the </br>
				unprofessionalism of the professor and the TAs in how they handled the course.

				DSC 102 - Data Visualization Project 2
			</a>
			</br>
			<h4>Description:</h4>
			<p>This was just a project where, given some pretty trash 30-second screencast of a sample </br>
				visualization, create your own version of it through Javascript and Highcharts. Terrible</br>
				project assignment in which we basically had to learn Highcharts and JS in one week ...</br>
				Mainly revolved around the theme of Homer Simpson's job and a possible energy visualization </br>
				that could be found at his job. </br>
				Pretty proud though based on how much it is capable of doing and how interactive it is.</br>
				***NOTE*** You have to zoom out in the project to get the whole scope of it</br>
				I could have fixed this issue with more HTML/CSS tricks, but it was 3am and I did some hardcoding</br>
				Fight me.</p>

				DSC 102 - Data Visualization Final
			</a>
			</br>
			<h4>Description:</h4>
			<p>Ooof now this was my fun little final project for this course. This consisted of three</br>
				visualizations about some data that Google has on me. There's a heatmap of my location history</br>
				that I did not make readily available because it is some pretty personal data. There's also </br>
				a tool to see and trace my daily location history for about ten days out of last quarter. </br>
				The last is a word map of my search histories from five different dates up to sometime last quarter.</p>
